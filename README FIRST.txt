STEPS TO INSTALL:
0. Get your STEAM ID from http://steamidfinder.com/ .
1. go into the userdata folder, and change YOUR_ID_HERE to your userdata steam id. 
2. Calculate your USERDATA steam id. This is usually (STEAM_ID * 2) + 1. For example, RAIGASM's steam ID is 0:1:30647, so his userdata ID is (30647 * 2) + 1, which is 61295.
3. Copy and paste both the steamapps and userdata folder into your steam folder, overwriting any duplicates when found.
4. Go into steamapps/common/counter-strike global offensive/csgo/cfg and check out the autoexec.cfg file and the files inside the rai/ folder to customize to your liking!
