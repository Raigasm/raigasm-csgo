# RAIGASM CSGO Config (READ ME)
## How to Install

1. Download and extract `RAIGASM CSGO Config.zip`
2. Get your STEAM ID from http://steamidfinder.com/ . It should look like `STEAM_0:X:Y` - we care about the last set of digits (the `Y`).
3. Calculate your USERDATA steam id. This is usually (STEAM_ID * 2) + 1. For example, RAIGASM's steam ID is 0:1:30647, so his userdata ID is (30647 * 2) + 1, which is 61295.
4. go into the userdata folder **you downloaded**, and change YOUR_ID_HERE to your userdata steam id.
5. Copy and paste both the steamapps and userdata folder into your steam folder, overwriting any duplicates when found.-


## How to Customize

Go into `steamapps/common/counter-strike global offensive/csgo/cfg` and check out the **autoexec.cfg** file and the files inside the `rai/` folder to customize to your liking!
